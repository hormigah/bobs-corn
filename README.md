# Software Engineer Challenge - Bob's Corn

This project has the following applications:
- Front-end App: Show an user interface where users can buy corn by click on a button and they can show how much corn they have bought.
- Backend app: exposes an API Rest where users can buy a corn and show how much corn they have bought
- Postgres databases: Database SQL where persist users data and orders data
